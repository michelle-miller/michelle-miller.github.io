The following examples illustrate my ability to craft helpful UI content:

## Tooltips

Keep helpful information in reach whenever possible.

## Learn more links

Implement a progressive disclosure model that lets users control when they get more information.

The *Learn more* link shown in this screenshot opens the first user help example that is listed in [Show, don't tell](user-help.html#show-dont-tell).
 
## UI walkthroughs

Build walkthroughs that help users to get familiar with new tools.
