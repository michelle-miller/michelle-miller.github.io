## Product user help

My current focus is on documentation that helps customers use foundation models and generative AI to improve their day-to-day business workflows.

IBM watson.xai: [Developing generative AI solutions with foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYOK8/wsj/analyze-data/fm-overview.html)

Earlier projects include cloud services for search, chatbot dialog building, and NLP tasks.

- [IBM Watson Discovery](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data)
- [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-index)
- [IBM Watson Knowledge Studio](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-wks_overview_full)

### Using visual elements in conceptual information

A picture is worth a thousand words, although the image's alt text should have fewer! The following links show content that effectively incorporates images to illustrate a concept or explain a process.

- [Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning workflow](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSLSRPV_latest/wsj/analyze-data/fm-tuning-methods-lora.html#lora-workflow)
- [Rerank passages](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYOK8/wsj/analyze-data/fm-api-rerank.html#api)
- [Model parameters for prompting](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYOK8/wsj/analyze-data/fm-model-parameters.html)

### Helping users make decisions

The why is more important than the how! Documentation is where you can provide more context about why a customer should complete a task. These examples show ways to describe and compare options for a customer to consider before making a key decision.

- [Choosing a foundation model](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYOK8/wsj/analyze-data/fm-models-choose.html)
- [Methods for tuning foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSLSRPV_latest/wsj/analyze-data/fm-tuning-methods.html)

### Single-sourcing user content

The following links show content that is single-sourced in Markdown with Microsoft Visual Studio Code and published to two separate documentation sites for SaaS and on-premises users:

- SaaS: [Supported foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYOK8/wsj/analyze-data/fm-models.html)
- On premises: [Supported foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSLSRPV_latest/wsj/analyze-data/fm-models.html)

## Developer help

The following guidance augments the watsonx.ai API reference:

- [IBM watsonx.ai time series forecasting](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYOK8/wsj/analyze-data/fm-api-time-series.html)
- [IBM watsonx.ai text extraction](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYOK8/wsj/analyze-data/fm-api-text-extraction.html)

The following guidance helps low-code users implement a simple RAG pattern and chat about images:

- [IBM watsonx.ai chatting about documents and images](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYOK8/wsj/analyze-data/fm-prompt-data.html)

### API reference

The API reference for the Watson Discovery search service is sourced from a JSON file that is created according to the OpenAPI specification.

- [Discovery API reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/discovery-data)

More guidance for developers is available from the product documentatation. For example, [Query overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-concepts).

## Administrator help

The following content is written in DITA with Oxygen XML Author

- IBM watsonx.ai on-premises installation: [Installing IBM watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSNFH6_latest/svc-watsonxai/watsonxai-install.html)
- IBM watsonx.ai on-premises administration: [Administering IBM watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSNFH6_latest/svc-watsonxai/watsonxai-admin.html)
