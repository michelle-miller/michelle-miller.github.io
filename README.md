## Product user help

My current focus is on documentation that helps customers use foundation models to improve their day-to-day business workflows.

- IBM watson.xai: [Developing generative AI solutions with foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYOK8/wsj/analyze-data/fm-overview.html)

Earlier projects include cloud services for search, chatbot dialog building, and NLP tasks.

- [IBM Watson Discovery](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data)
- [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-index)
- [IBM Watson Knowledge Studio](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-wks_overview_full)

### Using visual elements in conceptual information

A picture is worth a thousand words, although the image's alt text should be fewer words than that! The following links show content that effectively incorporates images to illustrate a concept or explain a process.

- [Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning workflow](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSLSRPV_latest/wsj/analyze-data/fm-tuning-methods-lora.html#lora-workflow)
- [Rerank passages](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYOK8/wsj/analyze-data/fm-api-rerank.html#api)
- [Model parameters for prompting](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYOK8/wsj/analyze-data/fm-model-parameters.html)

### Content that helps users make decisions

The why is more important than the how! Documentation is where you can provide more context about why a customer should complete a task. These examples show ways to describe and compare options for a customer to consider before making a key decision.

- [Methods for tuning foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSLSRPV_latest/wsj/analyze-data/fm-tuning-methods.html)
- [Choosing a foundation model](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYOK8/wsj/analyze-data/fm-models-choose.html)

### Single-sourcing user content

The following links show content that is single-sourced in Markdown and published for both SaaS and on-premises users:

- SaaS: [Supported foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYOK8/wsj/analyze-data/fm-models.html)
- On premises: [Supported foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSLSRPV_latest/wsj/analyze-data/fm-models.html)

## Developer help
