# User help

This page has links to content that was written by me and that illustrates various approaches for providing straight-forward, helpful information.

The approaches include:

- [Show, don't tell](#show-dont-tell)
- [Focus on user goals](#focus-on-user-goals-not product-features)
- [Give decision-point advice](#give-decision-point-advice)
- [Write it once](#write-it-once)
- [Target diverse learning methods](#target-diverse-learning-methods)
- [Befriend AI](#befriend-ai)

Note: Most of the following examples are shared as point-in-time PDFs rather than links to online help pages that are now maintained by other writers.

## Show, don't tell

Incorporate images and diagrams in conceptual information to illustrate concepts and explain processes.
 
- Explain how to adjust AI model behavior: [IBM watsonx.ai: Parameters for prompting foundation models](https://michelle-miller.github.io/samples/wx-llm-parameters-sample.pdf){:target="_blank"} 
- Help low-code users implement a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pattern: [IBM watsonx.ai: Chatting about documents and images](https://michelle-miller.github.io/samples/wx-chatting-sample.pdf){:target="_blank"} 

## Focus on user goals, not product features

The following two samples show content for a tool called Content Miner in IBM Watson Discovery before and after I revised the information to be task-based:

## Give decision-point advice

Describe and compare available options to help customers make good choices.

- [IBM watsonx.ai: Methods for tuning foundation models](https://michelle-miller.github.io/samples/wx-tuning.pdf){:target="_blank"}

## Write it once

Single-source user content when possible to save time and resources. 

The following online topic is single-sourced in Markdown and included in two different IBM watsonx.ai doc sets:
 
| | |
|-|-|
| Software-as-a-service docs | [When to tune a model](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSYOK8/wsj/analyze-data/fm-tuning-when.html){:target="_blank"} |
| On-premises docs| [When to tune a model](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSLSRPV_2.1.x/wsj/analyze-data/fm-tuning-when.html){:target="_blank"} |

## Target diverse learning methods

Give users more than one way to digest information.

In this topic, the same information is covered both in the table and in the paragraphs that follow the table: [IBM watsonx.ai: Security and privacy for foundation models](https://michelle-miller.github.io/samples/wx-security.html){:target="_blank"} 

## Befriend AI

Write content that can be consumed by LLMs as part of a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pattern to return factual answers. 

I optimized the documentation for retrieval by the IBM watsonx.ai LLM-based search app and regularly reviewed search results and user feedback to improve how the help content performs.<br/>**Try it out**: In the [Find information](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/welcome-main.html?context=wx){:target="_blank"} field, add a question and then click the bee icon.
