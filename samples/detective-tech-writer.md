Many, many years ago, my mother provided daycare a few days a week for my nephew, Michael. Michael–who is now an adult and unsurprisingly an engineer–used to constantly ask her about how things worked. “Why is there frost on the grass this morning?”, for example. My mother would answer, and Michael would inevitably respond with a series of follow-up “why” questions. 

My mother's tack was to answer each successive inquiry until she ran out of answers, and then say, “Why has a long tale”. Now, lovers of language might appreciate this response for its cleverness as a pun, meaning both that it would take too long to answer and that the letter “y”, when written, has a long tale. But it bewildered and understandably frustrated my nephew. 

In my mother’s defense, she may not have known all the answers. And we didn’t have Google back then. If the answer wasn’t in our Encyclopedia Brittanica book set published 10 years earlier, it would have to remain a mystery.

I learned a lot from my nephew’s questions. More than any single answer, the thing I gained most was an appreciation for the power of the word, “why”. After all, my mother was not an easy woman to stump.

## The role of *why* in technical writing

As technical writers, asking why is our job. The users of the products we document, the people we advocate for, are trying to get something done. They need us to provide the right information at the right time to help them succeed. It is our duty, from our privileged position embedded with the developers and designers who create the product, to ask the right questions. Because if we don’t, who will?

## Who doesn't love a whodunnit?

I’m a huge fan of mysteries: books, movies, you name it. When you watch a clever detective examine a crime scene, you see first hand the power of asking why. The good detectives always focus on the motivations of people. “Why did the victim bring her umbrella to work if she was planning to get a lift home?”, for example. They get hung up on details that seem to their apathetic peers to be trivial matters. "Who cares why he's holding a bird whistle?", they ask. 

The best mysteries find a way to hinge the solution to the mystery on a mundane, everyday action that brings all the previously disjointed facts that the hero detective's persistence collected together into a feasible timeline of events.

Similarly, as technical writers, we can’t know the right questions to ask unless we focus on the motivations and mundane everyday actions of our users. What task is the user trying to accomplish? Why would they use this new flashy feature instead of that other, similar feature that was released six months ago to an equal amount of fanfare at the time? What circumstances make it best to use one versus the other to get a task done?

## My challenge to tech writers everywhere

Conjure your inner Miss Marple to understand the motivations of your users. Then, pepper your developers with questions that fill any gaps between the user’s goal and the product’s function. Weaponize the word *why* like lives are at stake. Because, although it’s not lives exactly, the composure, success, and thus trust of your users actually is.
