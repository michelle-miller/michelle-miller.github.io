# Developer help

IBM watsonx.ai provides REST API reference documentation that conforms to the OpenAPI specification, which doesn't allow for comparisons or deeper explanations.

I added guidance to the product help that augments the API reference information. Here are a few of the topics I added which have graphics that help to explain how the methods work:

## Watson Discovery API reference

I created the following API reference from a JSON file that conforms to the OpenAPI specification:

- [Discovery API reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/discovery-data){:target="_blank"}

  ![Screenshot of the Discovery API reference that shows the query options which are described in the diagram shown later](images/disco-rest-api.png)

Different processing steps are available depending on the query method you use. I added supplemental guidance to the product documentatation to help developers understand their options and make the right choice.

## Watson Assistant developer content

These Spring Expression Language (SpEL) descriptions and examples help chatbot builders implement more advanced logic in their IBM Watson Assistant dialog flows:
